# perf-vu-meter

A tiny program to control analog VU meters hooked up to a Blue Pill (stm32f103) card.
Please refer to: <https://predictabledesigns.com/introduction-stm32-blue-pill-stm32duino/>

The firmware for the microcontroller can be found here: <https://github.com/sjm42/vumeter-usb>
Instead of Arduino C/C++ the firmware is also written in Rust and it talks USB.
